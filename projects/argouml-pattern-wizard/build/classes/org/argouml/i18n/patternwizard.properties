	It is possible to reengineer existing software-systems and integrate design patterns with the help of the Pattern-Wizard. It is also possible to create new applications with the help of design patterns.\n\
	\n\
	Instructions:\n\
    1. Decide which "Available Patterns" you want to combine to a "New Pattern".\n\
    2. If you want to combine the selected patterns with already existing classes you need to select the corresponding classes in ArgoUML and afterwards activate "Transform selected ArgoUML classes".\n\
    3. Within the components-tab it is possible to rename the classes, attributes and methods and combine them by drag&drop with each other. It is also possible to change the assigned stereotypes.\n\
    4. Within the relation-tab it is possible to rename the associations, generalizations, ... and to change the assigned stereotypes.\n\
    5. If it happens that there are several relations between the same classes due to the combination of classes, these relations can be combined by drag&drop.\n\
    6. With a click on the Ok-button all manipulations made will be applied in ArgoUML.\n\
